## Languages
- Python
  - Creation : 1980s By Van Rossum

  - Compilation :
  	- Most modern OS are written in C; compilers/interpreters for high-level languages also likely written in C Language itself (Python) is a just set of rules
  		- Cpython : most popular/traditional implementation
  		- Cython : 'superset of Python', can give Python C-like performance
  - Variations : Cpython(default), Pypy
  - Performance : 
  	- abstracting details (memory managements), runtime interpretation (than compiling to native code in prior) makes it slower than C.
