## Internet
- 

## Languages
- **Python** / created in 1980s By Van Rossum 
  - Philosophy : 
  	- High-level, readable code with significant whitespcace
  	- Dynamic type system with automatic memory management
  	- Errors explicit, Object-oriented, imperative, functional
  - Compilation :
  	- Most modern OS are written in C; compilers/interpreters for high-level languages also likely written in C Language itself (Python) is a just set of rules
  		- Cpython : most popular/traditional implementation
  		- Cython : 'superset of Python', can give Python C-like performance
  - Variants : Cpython(default), Pypy, Jython
  - Performance : 
  	- abstracting details (memory managements), runtime interpretation (than compiling to native code in prior) makes it slower than C.

- **C** / created in 1972 by Ritchie (to re-implement Unix)
  - Philosophy : 
  	- Low-level access to memory
  	- Very light, no built-in OOP
  - Compilation : 
  	- Compiled to native code in prior 


- **Javascript** / created in 1995 by Eich
  - Philosophy : 
  - Javascript = ECMAScript + DOM API
  	- ECMASCript : standard for scripting languages
  	- DOM API : allows communication between HTML and XML
  - Threading : 
  	- No native threading in Javascript
  	- "AJAX" : Asynchronous Javascript and XML (extensive markup languages)


## Web architecture

  - cf) Supernode
- Indexing (to what extent?)
  - cf) Supernode

## Networks and Scalability
- Distributing to different servers
  - Philosophy : 
- C
  - Philosophy : 

## Operational Systems and Architecture
- Threading v. Processes
  - Philosophy : 
  - Pros v. cons of multi-threading : 
- Virtual memory
  - Philosophy :
  - Docker :  
- Page swap, paging
  - Philosophy : 
- SSD, RAM, memory
  - Philosophy : 
- Stack v. heap
  - Philosophy :
